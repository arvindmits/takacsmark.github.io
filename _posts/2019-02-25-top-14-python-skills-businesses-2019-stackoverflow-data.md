## Your most relevant questions about Python

Our aim is to answer a couple of key questions about Python and its
ecosystem with the use of real-life data coming from Stackoverflow. We
all feel the buzz around Python lately and we might ask questions like
the ones below.

  - Shall I or someone in my team start to **learn Python?**
  - Where shall I see the **benefits of Python** in my daily
    life/business?
  - Shall I start with Python **2.x or 3.x**?
  - What is the hype around Python? I know I can do anything with it,
    but what makes it so special, **what do others really build with
    it**?

I compiled the article to answer your questions along practical lines.
We look at the following angles.

  - I show you the **number of Stackoverflow questions and their growth
    trends over the past 6 months for the leading programming
    languages**, so that you can compare the trends of Python,
    JavaScript, Java, C\# and others.
  - I introduce **the key domains of Python**. We'll do this by
    looking at the Stackoverflow tags that are most often used with the
    `python` tag in Stackoverflow questions.
  - We look at the **growth trends of the top domains** we identified
    in the previous point and depict graphs to better visualize what's
    going on.
  - Finally, we explore relevant **growth segments of the Python
    universe** and show you what **actions you can take** to make the
    next step on your Python journey.

What makes this report unique?

  - **We combine two Stackoverflow data dumps from June 2018 and
    December 2018** and create growth figures of this period.
  - The two dumps let you look at the **growth in question views which
    is the best measure of real life usage**.
  - Special **growth segments give you insights that we turn into an
    action plan right in the report**.

*Hope you are ready to explore the world of Python, let's get started\!*

## The world's leading programming languages

According to Stackoverflow data, these are the world's leading
programming languages based on the total number of questions created
since 2008.

| \# | Tag name   | Questions |
| -- | ---------- | --------- |
| 1  | javascript | 1723731   |
| 2  | java       | 1487235   |
| 3  | c\#        | 1264947   |
| 4  | php        | 1245650   |
| 5  | android    | 1155005   |
| 6  | python     | 1068679   |
| 7  | jquery     | 936264    |
| 8  | html       | 789778    |
| 9  | c++        | 595978    |
| 10 | ios        | 584135    |

You can read a detailed report about [2019 tech trends based on
Stackoverflow data in a previous
article](https://takacsmark.com/2019-top-technology-trends-stackoverflow-analysis/){:target="_blank"},
where you'll find more details about the high level numbers and trends.

The above table reflects the reality of the past decade where most
players migrated to **web applications mainly using JavaScript
(including JQuery), PHP and HTML**.

The table also illustrates the heavy use of **Java and C\# in enterprise
projects**, and the expansion of **mobile technology with Android and
iOS**.

**Good old C++** holds position 9, it's still widely used in enterprise
applications and let's also not forget about game development.

**Python takes the 6th place** with its general purpose scripting
capabilities, web frameworks and scientific and AI toolkit.

### What makes Python special

Let me show you the growth in new questions created for the programming
languages listed above.

| \# | Tag name   | Questions Growth % |
| -- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| 1  | python     | 11.04              |
| 2  | javascript | 6.14               |
| 3  | html       | 4.97               |
| 4  | css        | 4.86               |
| 5  | java       | 4.68               |
| 6  | android    | 4.40               |
| 7  | c\#        | 4.25               |
| 8  | c++        | 4.13               |
| 9  | mysql      | 4.08               |
| 10 | php        | 3.77               |

**These are the figures that put Python into the focus of this
article**.

**You find Python at the top of the list this time.** The growth of new
Python questions created in the past 6 moths clearly exceeds the average
growth rate of its peer group.

The difference becomes even more evident if we look at the `python-3.x`
tag.

| \# | Tag name   | Questions Growth % |
| -- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| 1  | python-3.x | 27.76              |

**There is clearly something happening in the industry that makes
projects turn towards Python's capabilities in large numbers.**

*Let's discover what's behind the growing Python demand\!*

## The numbers behind the Python ecosystem

Stackoverflow questions are usually tagged with multiple tags. This
helps users find relevant questions coming from various tag based views.

**Let's look at the most common tags that are used together with the
`python` tag in Stackoverflow questions.**

| \# | Tag name          | Questions |
| -- | ----------------- | --------- |
| 1  | python            | 1065497   |
| 2  | django            | 94477     |
| 3  | python-3.x        | 83044     |
| 4  | pandas            | 76782     |
| 5  | python-2.7        | 56511     |
| 6  | numpy             | 48520     |
| 7  | list              | 34168     |
| 8  | matplotlib        | 29592     |
| 9  | dictionary        | 24332     |
| 10 | regex             | 22212     |
| 11 | dataframe         | 20465     |
| 12 | flask             | 19775     |
| 13 | tkinter           | 19333     |
| 14 | string            | 18015     |
| 15 | tensorflow        | 17713     |
| 16 | csv               | 17615     |
| 17 | arrays            | 17346     |
| 18 | json              | 15367     |
| 19 | selenium          | 12662     |
| 20 | html              | 12348     |
| 21 | beautifulsoup     | 11798     |
| 22 | google-app-engine | 11546     |
| 23 | mysql             | 11509     |
| 24 | scipy             | 11144     |
| 25 | opencv            | 10872     |

Let's see what these numbers tell you:

  - **There are over 1 million questions tagged `python` on
    Stackoverflow**. Questions usually have multiple tags assigned to
    them, that's why the `python` number is so much higher that the
    others.
  - The **Django web framework** has the top place amongst the niche
    tags, showing the popularity of Django in the past years.
  - Python maintains two active versions; Python 2.x and Python 3.x.
    Both of them are used in production systems. Python 3.x was designed
    to be the "future of Python". According to the numbers the
    transition is well on its way.
  - **Web application** development with Django and Flask is a
    significant Python use-case.
  - **Data science, statistical computing** with Pandas, Numpy,
    Matplotlib and further packages is another key area.
  - **Machine learning** with Tensorflow and OpenCV is an additional
    important field with other solutions we'll explore later.
  - **Web scraping** with Beatifulsoup and Selenium is one more common
    Python scenario.

The above table shows the number of questions created by users. *We have
the data to look at the number of times questions with certain tags are
looked at by users on Stackoverflow in the table below.*

| \# | Tag name   | Views      |
| -- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1  | python     | 2462915693 |
| 2  | list       | 142398873  |
| 3  | pandas     | 142161227  |
| 4  | django     | 139767711  |
| 5  | numpy      | 117853743  |
| 6  | string     | 116990138  |
| 7  | python-3.x | 114085122  |
| 8  | python-2.7 | 103820542  |
| 9  | matplotlib | 89430879   |
| 10 | dictionary | 79582148   |
| 11 | pip        | 54533093   |
| 12 | dataframe  | 46473150   |
| 13 | arrays     | 43928691   |
| 14 | json       | 39712693   |
| 15 | file       | 38502362   |
| 16 | datetime   | 37685124   |
| 17 | flask      | 34957618   |
| 18 | windows    | 33861450   |
| 19 | csv        | 32177110   |
| 20 | regex      | 31699530   |
| 21 | tkinter    | 30903428   |
| 22 | scipy      | 27193466   |
| 23 | unicode    | 25776364   |
| 24 | linux      | 24963227   |
| 25 | opencv     | 23545548   |

View counts seem to be a great measure of real-life use, because once a
question is asked, it is usually not asked again. The question remains
available online so that anyone can look at it when they are looking for
the solution provided in the question's answers.

**You can see subtle differences here**.

  - The `django` tag has the highest number of questions (after the main
    tag `python`) on the first table, but it is not the most viewed tag
    by users. **Both `list` and `pandas` get more hits**.
  - Also note the high number of **Windows views compared to Linux
    viewers**.

*Having listed all major tags used together with the `python` tag, it's
time we look at the trends of Python domains we just identified.*

## Growth trends of Python's key domains

Let's plot the growth trends of the key Python domains we identified in
the previous section.

  - New Python questions in total.
  - Python 2.x vs Python 3.x.
  - Web application development with Django and Flask.
  - Data science and machine learning.
  - Web scraping.

The graphs show the overall number of questions created per month for
the given tag.

Please note that numbers in the previous section showed the number of
questions tagged with a given tag where the question was also tagged
with the `python` tag. **This time we are looking at the number of
questions tagged with a given tag disregarding all other tags**.

### New Python questions

The creation of new Python questions has a stable upward slope; a clear
sign of a buzzing
ecosystem.

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/in-content/python-so-questions-trends-2018.png)

### Python 2.7 vs 3.x

Python 3.x has a higher overall question creation number and the
creation curve shows continuous growth. The number of new Python 2.7
questions seems to be at a turning
point.

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/in-content/python2-so-questions-trends-2018.png)

### Django and Flask

**Django and Flask show stable usage** with both Django and Flask
producing slow, sporadic growth. These segments are not in
high-growth.

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/in-content/flask-so-questions-trends-2018.png)

### Data science and machine learning

This is what a clear growth curve looks like. **Pandas and `dataframe`
questions are clearly on the rise** signaling that data science is a
current hot
topic.

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/in-content/pandas-so-questions-trends-2018.png)

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/in-content/dataframe-so-questions-trends-2018.png)

If you look at the next two graphs, you'll find that **machine learning
produced a few extreme spikes** and Tensorflow is on the top list of
total questions
created.

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/in-content/tensorflow-so-questions-trends-2018.png)

### Web scraping

With big data comes the big need for data. **Web scraping is one way to
collect information for data mining and machine learning projects**.

**Python has always been one of the go-to technologies in web
scraping**. (I personally choose a combination of PHP and JavaScript to
run a web scraping based venture for several years, but today I would go
with Python and a headless browser.)

Since Python is a popular way to process your data, it makes sense to
collect your data with a Python based solution.

*Here comes the part where you find individual go-to technologies and
action-able insights in the world of Python.*

## Growth segments of the Python ecosystem

Let's identify the high-growth domains of Python by looking at the
growth in question views in the 6 month period between June 2018 and
December 2018.

Let's look at growth percentage in the following tables.

We examine Python segments based on the number of questions a tag has:

  - **Established technologies** - tags with over 15k questions
  - **Emerging technologies**- tags with 10k to 15k questions
  - **Trending technologies** - tags with 5k to 10k questions
  - **Top newcomers** - tags with less than 5k questions

### Growth of established technologies

These are the heavy tags that have been around for long enough to have a
stable user base and mature solutions. Users look at both old and new
questions to find out how to solve daily challenges.

| \# | Tag name   | Views Growth % |
| -- | ---------- | -------------- |
| 1  | tensorflow | 47.17          |
| 2  | dataframe  | 41.02          |
| 3  | pandas     | 37.27          |
| 4  | python-3.x | 28.28          |
| 5  | flask      | 23.11          |
| 6  | csv        | 22.98          |
| 7  | numpy      | 22.88          |
| 8  | arrays     | 21.88          |
| 9  | matplotlib | 21.47          |
| 10 | python-2.7 | 20.83          |
| 11 | json       | 20.50          |
| 12 | tkinter    | 19.28          |
| 13 | python     | 18.45          |
| 14 | list       | 18.42          |
| 15 | dictionary | 18.15          |

**These are industry trends you should be active in right now**.

  - **Tensorflow, DataFrame and Pandas** are in high demand,
    experiencing around 40% growth in question views in 6 months.
  - Besides the above tags we find **`Numpy`, `csv`, `arrays`,
    `Matplotlib`, `list` and `dictionary` from the data manipulation
    domain**.
  - Flask question creation numbers were not too impressive, yet
    **question views put Flask into the fifth place**. Having `json` on
    this list tells me that using Python (and Flask) to build APIs is
    probably a strong use case.
  - **`Tkinter` made it to the growth list, too**. This is bit of a
    surprise to me, because I don't know any client or project team who
    uses Tkinter to build stuff. I have some assumptions, but I prefer
    no to throw wild guesses into the article. Please leave a comment if
    you are using Tkinter in your projects and tell us what you're
    building with it.

### Growth of emerging technologies

These tags are also established with a strong base, although somewhat
smaller than the ones in the previous chapter.

| \# | Tag name         | Views Growth % |
| -- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| 1  | machine-learning | 36.82          |
| 2  | opencv           | 26.14          |
| 3  | selenium         | 23.13          |
| 4  | beautifulsoup    | 18.46          |
| 5  | sqlalchemy       | 18.42          |
| 6  | scipy            | 17.58          |
| 7  | html             | 17.34          |
| 8  | mysql            | 14.56          |
| 9  | multithreading   | 14.39          |
| 10 | linux            | 13.99          |

**These are the capabilities you should be actively developing**.

  - Python based **Machine learning** is on top with both
    `machine-learning` and `opencv`.
  - `Beatifulsoup`, `selenium` and `html` are all related to **web
    scraping**, although Selenium is a testing framework it is often
    used to scrape web sites especially with heavy JavaScript.
  - **`SQLAlchemy` and `mysql`** show that Python based applications are
    primarily connected to SQL databases although NoSQL connectors are
    also available.
  - The rise of `multithreading` and `Linux` suggests that Python is
    used in performance intensive applications in Cloud environments.

> Actions you may take:
> 
>   - Build machine learning skills with Python.
>   - Explore computer vision with OpenCV.
>   - Get started with data collection through web scraping.
>   - Consider Python based cloud solution options in performance
>     intensive scenarios. Think APIs, scripting and automation.

### Growth of trending technologies

These tags are from smaller niche segments.

| \# | Tag name              | Views Growth % |

| 14 | postgresql            | 18.01          |
| 15 | unit-testing          | 17.59          |

**These are the technologies to watch, and these are the domains you
should consider for future skill building.**

  - [Keras](https://keras.io/){:target="_blank"}, the Python **deep learning library**,
    had a 75% growth in view numbers.
  - [Django rest framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/){:target="_blank"}
    confirms our idea that many projects use **Python to build web
    APIs**.
  - The other tags are related to the domains we already mentioned in
    previous chapters. Please note how good old Excel made it to
    position 4. **If you work with data, Excel is your friend**.

> Actions you may take:
> 
>   - Experiment with Keras.
>   - Already a Django user? Check out the Django rest framework.
>   - Already Python user? Consider a pip training to improve
>     efficiency.

### Top new comers

These tags appear out of thin air and may or may not become a rising
star of the next period.

Let's highlight a few special points.

  - **[Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/){:target="_blank"} is an amazing project**,
    especially because it has exceptional learning materials on their
    web-site and on
    [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/howardjeremyp/playlists){:target="_blank"}. If
    you are looking for a superb learning experience I highly recommend
    these resources.
  - [Pipfile](https://github.com/pypa/pipfile){:target="_blank"} aims to replace
    `requirements.txt` with a superior solution and give us `Pipfile`
    and `Pipfile.loc`. The project is in active development, no stable
    release yet, still it has over 2600 stars on GitHub.
  - Last, but not least, here we go with the next level of our Skynet
    utopia. **[Tensorflow lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite){:target="_blank"} runs
    machine learning models on mobile and embedded devices**.

## Wrap-up

I hope you enjoyed the steps as we discovered Stackoverflow data behind
Python.

**Python is not only practical and capable, but it's also fun to work
with and it's easy to learn.**

Let's summarize the actions you may take again, so that you have them
all in one place.

Industry trends where you should be active right now.

  - If you start learning Python now, **start with Python 3.x**.
  - Get involved with **Tensorflow**.
  - Add Python tools to your data science toolkit. **Start learning
    Pandas, Matplotlib and Numpy**.
  - Need a flexible micro-framework for your web APIs? **Learn Flask**.

Capabilities you should be actively developing.

  - **Machine learning skills with Python**.
  - **Computer vision with OpenCV**.
  - Data collection through **web scraping**.
  - Python based cloud solution options in performance intensive
    scenarios. **APIs, scripting and automation**.

Domains you should consider for future skill building.

  - Experiment with **Keras**.
  - Already a Django user? **Check out the Django rest framework**.
  - Already a Python user? Consider a **pip training** to improve
    efficiency.
  - **Learn data manipulation basics**; Excel, CSV and SQL.
