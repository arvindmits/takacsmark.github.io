## Let's start with the bottom line

When I write about technology trends I always see a business manager in front of me who's working hard to reach targets and at the same time transform their own role and their organization to be more digital.

I talk to many people like you. We've all read about the trends, we have some vague, sci-fi like idea about the future, but here and now we have to find a logical and potentially profitable next step.

If you take one thing with you from this article, let it be this:

**Please, DO consider Augmented Reality investment in 2018. Practical business use cases have been implemented with clear benefits in the area of customer experience, engagement, work efficiency, emergency applications, entertainment and education.**

In this article I give you inspiring examples and use cases that may start to implement this year.

## Why invest into Augmented Reality?

I'm aware that Augmented Reality might be in the lower realms of your investment priorities right now.

I've seen serious investment into security, data science, AI, bots and IoT recently. While these topics usually lead the way, I've seen major investment into digital customer experiences both with AR and other means.

AR is a very special animal, because it's cross-industry. It can play well with any business in any field, and it can add value to other current technology trends.

So why is AR a special field and why should you consider AR in 2018?

- **Your AR investment may play well with you other digital projects, you can use AR to better realize the value of your ongoing initiatives.**
- A great thing about AR is that it's **directly connected to customer experience**. Use AR to engage with customers in whole new, inspiring ways.
- You implement AR in various ways; in a **mobile app, in smart glasses and in 2018 we'll have large AR walls** similar to large TV screen that give way to new, disruptive solutions.
- AR plays well with **data and AI**. Personal recommendations showcased with AR may be the key for your customers, just think of car sales, home decor or clothing.
- Manufacturing on a new level. Any scenario works well with AR, where enriching your view with **industry data** gives you an advantage.
- Sometimes **visualization is everything**. AR applications in education, field service, medicine, business and coding can make a real difference for your clients and colleagues.  

## 7 uses of augmented reality that will matter to your business

### 1. Consumer experience and shopping

Retail is the first field to be disrupted by AR applications. Gartner say, [by 2020, 100 million consumers will shop in augmented reality](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-predicts-a-virtual-world-of-exponential-change/).


You can enhance your web-shop, as well as your brick and mortar stores with stunning AR experiences. We'll se examples for both scenarios.

**Virtual fitting rooms, AR make-up mirrors and furniture preview apps have been on the market for over 5 years now, they have matured and have been embraced by customers They are not a just a nice option to have, any more.**

If you haven't met the classics yet, please take a loot at these examples:

- [Ikea Place](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ikea-place/id1279244498?mt=8), Ikea's furniture preview app lets you please furniture into your own place. Interesting technical detail about this app, that it uses [Apple's ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/arkit/), released by apple with Xcode 9 and iOS 11 to keep up with competition.

These application give invaluable benefits for both the company and individual colleagues. Co-workers will feel more confident, because they can rely on real-time visual assistance, that will make them more successful at the end of day.

The entire organization will enjoy the benefits of improved quality, reduced maintenance time and a well trained, happy workforce.

**Typical features in AR maintenance include: indoor navigation, maintenance training, job review, step-by-step guidance, security access management, dashboards and status information, real-time feedback and alerting.**

### 3. Telemedicine, AR treatment and visual aid

You'll see medical application of AR in three main categories:
#### Telemedicine, where AR is used by doctors and medical personnel as an assistance tool

The [Nomadeec](http://nomadeec.com) Hololens helps with the assessment of the ambulatory patient with visual assessment, real time ECG results, connected tele-consultation and more.

#### AR applications used to provide medical therapy

[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center](https://www.cedars-sinai.org) started an initiative to use virtual reality as medical treatment. The used therapeutic videos where patient can fly over iceland, paint in an art studio and swim with dolphins. As a result of their [study](https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/About-Us/News/News-Releases-2017/Cedars-Sinai-Study-Finds-Virtual-Reality-Therapy-Helps-Decrease-Pain-in-Hospitalized-Patients.aspx) they found that Virtual Reality therapy helps decrease pain in hospitalized patients.

### 4. Education

### 5. Entertainment and gaming
### 6. Creatives and makers - modeling and architecture
### 7. General business use, presentations, data visualization IT applications - code and data visualization https://primitive.io





Our social life and entertainment is evolving in ways where personal visualizations play a key role.

Augmented Reality is the next stepping stone towards advanced interactions and user experiences.

When we're using wearable A/R applications (like the Hololens), we are actually not just augmenting reality. What happens is that we are upgrading human perception, we gain superpowers like augmented vision, data enriched perception and a whole new level of interactivity (just think of the way you point and click with your fingers in front of the Hololens).
