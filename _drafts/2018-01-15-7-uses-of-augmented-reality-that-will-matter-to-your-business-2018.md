## Let's start with the bottom line

When I write about technology trends I always see a business manager in front of me who's working hard to reach targets and at the same time transform their own role and their organization to be more digital.

I talk to many people like you. We've all read about the trends, we have some vague, sci-fi like idea about the future, but here and now we have to find a logical and potentially profitable next step.

If you take one thing with you from this article, let it be this:

**Please, DO consider Augmented Reality investment in 2018. Practical business use cases have been implemented with clear benefits in the area of customer experience, engagement, work efficiency, emergency applications, entertainment and education.**

In this article I give you inspiring examples and use cases that may start to implement this year.

## Why invest into Augmented Reality?

I'm aware that Augmented Reality might be in the lower realms of your investment priorities right now.

I've seen serious investment into security, data science, AI, bots and IoT recently. While these topics usually lead the way, I've seen major investment into digital customer experiences both with AR and other means.

AR is a very special animal, because it's cross-industry. It can play well with any business in any field, and it can add value to other current technology trends.

So, what do I mean by this? Your AR investment may play well with you other digital projects, on top of this you can use AR to better realize the value of your ongoing initiatives.

Let's say you have invested into data collection in your manufacturing site, and now you have all the data of your entire production line in a central repository. Now it's time to apply human or artificial intelligence to make your data work for you. Looking over your production line with an engineer's knowledge augmented with key metrics may save you a lot of time and money. Especially if potential failures and preventive maintenance actions are also highlighted.

AR plays well with data, and guided recommendations. Any scenario works well with AR, where enriching your view with data gives you advantage.

Another good thing about A/R is that it is directly connected to customer and user experience. Use AR to engage with customers and co-workers in whole new, inspiring ways.

Retail is the first field to be disrupted by AR applications. Gartner say, [by 2020, 100 million consumers will shop in augmented reality](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-predicts-a-virtual-world-of-exponential-change/).

You can completely change the life of your colleagues by making them more successful at work with AR tools.

## 7 uses of augmented reality that will matter to your business

### 1. Consumer experience and shopping

You can enhance your web-shop, as well as your brick and mortar stores with stunning AR experiences. We'll se examples for both scenarios.

**Virtual fitting rooms, AR make-up mirrors and furniture preview apps have been on the market for over 5 years now, they have matured and have been embraced by customers They are not a just a nice option to have, any more.**

If you haven't met the classics yet, please take a loot at these examples:

- [Ikea Place](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ikea-place/id1279244498?mt=8), Ikea's furniture preview app lets you please furniture into your own place. Interesting technical detail about this app, that it uses [Apple's ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/arkit/), released by apple with Xcode 9 and iOS 11 to keep up with competition.

- Augmented reality mirrors are everyday reality already. [Modiface](http://modiface.com/) is one of the most successful players in this space, their technology is [supporting top make-up brands](https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/19/facial-precognition/) worldwide.

    Mobiface and their technology provides solutions for the key challenges in the beauty arena, like skin assessment, lipstick color recommendations, live make-up and real-time hair color previews.

Some other classic retail examples include the [Uniqlo magic mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=oUD57MpHAE8) or [Converse the sampler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBQzXi04JpE).

**AR dressing rooms in physical stores and interactive AR shopwindow experiences are common place. They are practical and also engaging and fun for customers.**

**Online retailers, like Amazon, are investing into AR to help customers visualize products in the physical space when shopping online.**

Amazon just released AR view in November 2017 in the Amazon app.

## A new perspective on AR

But let me start with a point that I think is very important. I think, and this is my personal oppinion, that Augmented Reality is not just another technology trend. It is connected to many other trends that influence our lives.

The reason why I'm saying this is that A/R fundamentally changes the way we interact with the world around us. Other trends will go on and support the use case for such advanced interactions.

We gather more and more data from our surrounding and use these data to make decisions. Data driven insights often are present in real-time, event based ways. We can see various use cases at work and also in the household.

Our social life and entertainment is evolving in ways where personal visualizations play a key role.

Augmented Reality is the next stepping stone towards advanced interactions and user experiences.

When we're using wearable A/R applications (like the Hololens), we are actually not just augmenting reality. What happens is that we are upgrading human perception, we gain superpowers like augmented vision, data enriched perception and a whole new level of interactivity (just think of the way you point and click with your fingers in front of the Hololens).

Such upgraded   


You are probably focusing on various super influential trends in 2018, like industry automation, data science, machine learning, autonomous AI, personal assistants, bots, crypto, blockchain, I'm sure we could list many more.

If you ask the IT industry, I think for most of us the most influential trend is the global shortage of programmers and IT talent.  

Why do I think that


Finding the balance between "head in the clouds" and "feet on the ground" when we are creating new digital offerings is quite a challenge. Innovation ideas are often communicated with overwhelming passion and we get the feeling that implementing a new, cool trend is more important than understanding how we make this investment profitable.

In this article I will focus on use cases that you may describe as incremental innovation. What I mean by that is that we'll see use cases that you can implement in 2018 in your business and where the business value does not require too much clarification, because it's almost self-explanatory.
